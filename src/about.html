    <h1>Guess Who?</h1>

    <h4>OBJECT OF THE GAME</h4>
Your object is to guess the mystery person on your opponent’s card by asking one question per turn, and
eliminating any faces that don’t fit the mystery person’s description. Guess your opponent’s mystery person
before your opponent guesses yours and you win!
<h4>CONTENTS </h4>
2 plastic gameboard units, 24 mystery cards, 48 face cards and face frames,
2 score keepers
<h4>SET UP (The First Time You Play)</h4>
1. Gently detach the 48 face cards from the sheet.
2. The red player takes the red face cards and slides them into the face frames
on his gameboard. The blue player does the same with the blue face cards.
It doesn’t matter which face card goes into each frame on the gameboard.
<h4>GAMEPLAY </h4>
Each player chooses a gameboard. Place your gameboard on a flat surface. Flip all of your frames upright
by tipping your gameboard away from you; then set your gameboard flat again. Your opponent does the
same.
<h4>Draw Your Mystery Card</h4>
Shuffle the mystery cards. Choose one
card at random and fit it into your mystery
card slot so that your mystery person faces
you. Your opponent does the same. Then
place all unused mystery cards face down
out of play. Sit facing your opponent, so
that he or she can’t see the mystery per-
son on your card!
<h4>The Gameboard Faces</h4>
Notice the differences among the 24 faces on your gameboard. Hair and eye colors are different; some
faces have beards, mustaches or big noses; some are wearing hats or glasses. As you play, you’ll notice
several other differences among the faces.
<h4>Your Turn</h4>
The youngest player always goes first. On your turn, you may either ask a question, or guess who the
mystery person is. But don’t use your turn to guess the mystery person until you’re ready. If your guess
is wrong, you’ll lose the game! Rules for asking questions and guessing the mystery person are explained
below.
<h4>Asking Questions</h4>
Until you’re ready to guess who the mystery person is, ask your opponent one question per turn. Each
question must have either a “yes” or “no” answer. For example, you may ask: “Does your person have
white hair?” Your opponent must then answer either “yes” or “no.”
After your opponent answers, you may be able to eliminate one or more of the faces. For example, if
the mystery person has white hair, flip down all the faces that have black, brown, red, or yellow hair. This
leaves only the white-haired people as the possible mystery person.
After you ask a question (and flip down any faces you can), your turn is over.
<h4>Guessing the Mystery Person</h4>
When you’re ready to guess who the mystery person is, make your guess on your turn, instead of asking
a question.
To guess the mystery person, say (for example), “The mystery person is Andy.” Your opponent must
then tell you whether or not your guess is correct. If your guess is right, you win the game! If it’s wrong,
you lose.
<h4>Winning the Game</h4>
Players alternate turns asking questions, until one player makes a guess. If you guess correctly – or your
opponent guesses incorrectly – you win the game!
<h4>CHALLENGE GAME</h4>
For an extra challenge, both players draw two mystery cards, and place them side-by-side in their mys-
tery card slots. Your object is to guess who both of your opponent’s mystery people are!
You must say “both” or “either” when asking questions about the mystery people. For example, you may
ask, “Do both of your people wear glasses?” or, “Does either of your people have black hair?” Be very
careful when eliminating gameboard faces – and remember which questions you’ve asked!
For example, you ask, “Does either of your people have a beard?” Your opponent answers “yes.” You
cannot flip down any faces, because although one mystery person definitely has a beard, the other one
may not!
To guess the mystery people correctly, you must guess both of them on the same turn.
<h4>CHAMPIONSHIP PLAY</h4>
If you wish to play a series of games, slide the scorekeeper up one point for every game you win. The
first player to win five games is the champion!
